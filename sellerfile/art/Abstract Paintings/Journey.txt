"It doesn't matter what you use for a journey,
 you will get to your destination," reflects 
Ghanaian artist David Mawunya Charway. As an 
example, he depicts a father giving his children 
a ride on a wheel barrow. Set in an arid land, 
the abstract composition is intended to demonstrate
 how people make do, when transportation is not an 
option in their region.
