Miriam Chipana

"I've been professionally dedicated to painting since I graduated from the School of Fine Arts in 1998. Ever since my school years I have always excelled in drawing and painting, and that is why after finishing secondary school I had already decided to study art. I need to dedicate myself to painting; it is my passion, and I have imposed it upon myself like a religious belief. 

"I am interested in form and texture, and I currently create both recognizable and abstract figures, forms that are genetic, yet diffuse, that can signify times or other subtle symbolism. I am passionate about my cultural inheritance, so full of clarity and mystery, above all the dual concept of the world: the known and the unknown. Like a river, my paintings try to collect everything, establishing a bond with the past through the forms and colors of the Andes. My paintings possess enigmas in order to be understood. 

"I create works in oils, acrylics, and watercolors. In some cases I make a sketch beforehand, and in others I go straight to the canvas, clear with a preconceived idea. I prefer colors like black, blue, and red because they express a lot of force, although in the first planes I also use orange. In my work I am guided more by the form than the color; in this process I can rectify things, but it is difficult to make substantial changes. The presence of felines can be noted in my work, abstract forms that I recreate; I can change them to make them subtler, without being primordial. 

"I've participated in four collective exhibitions in Peru and I continue down that path. I assumed my profession as a challenge, and despite the difficulties, I am happy with what I do. Through Novica I would like to say that my art is a return to the past splendor of my race that shows itself as it is and as it is perceived by its heirs. It is to show the past in a present, which surges spontaneously." 

Miriam Chipana was born in Lima in 1975.
