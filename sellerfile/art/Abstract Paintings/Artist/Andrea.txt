Andrea

"Hola, I'm María Andrea Facundo Palacios and I was born in Las Pirias de Cajamarca on December 18, 1988. When I was a little girl, I lived with my father and mother, and spent my time playing with my cousins and our animals. My parents aren't artists. They are farmers. But I liked to draw from the time I was ten years old and today I love to paint. 

"I studied in the art studio of master artist Tadeo Zavaleta (a Novica-featured painter). In 2005, I began to paint professionally, together with him. I admire him greatly and I'm very happy to be his disciple. Tadeo has been very well received in Peru and other countries, and he generously shares his knowledge. I love art. It fascinates me, and that is why I've chosen this wide and marvelous road in life. 

"Once, when I was just beginning, I was trying to paint a picture but I couldn't get it to come out the way I wanted it to. I tore it up and started again. 

"Abstraction and cubism are genres with which I can identify – abstract art because I feel free to express feelings. Painting in general is a form of communication, and in this way I can express what I feel. 

"I hope my painting pleases every one of you. My works will bring the joy of living to every corner of your homes."
