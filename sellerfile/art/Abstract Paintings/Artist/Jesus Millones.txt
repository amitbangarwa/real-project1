Jesus Millones

"I'm Jesús Millones de la Barra, born 8 October, 1978. I lived with my parents for most of my life, but when I was a teenager, and the economy being what it is, I had to work to help the financial situation at home. Even as a child, I've always loved anything related to art: I love to sing, act and paint. I remember clearly when I was about eight or nine years old, and my cousins would come to the house and we would prepare a little shows at home. We'd parody T.V. ads, comic sketches, and lip-sync to famous artists of the time. 

"One of those cousins is Tadeo Zavaleta (a Novica featured artist), and together we'd sing the Valicha, a traditional Peruvian song. Because it is in Quechua, we could only sing the same lines over and over for about five minutes. Our parents laughed as they rejoiced in our artistic spirit.
