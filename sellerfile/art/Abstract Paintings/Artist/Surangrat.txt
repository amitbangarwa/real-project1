Surangrat

"My name is Surangrat Vanchauy and I was born on 18 March 1981. Our Thai traditions and culture, as well as Buddhism, have made me what I am today. I studied Fine Arts at Chiang Mai University. The reason I chose Fine Arts was that it makes me see things in a positive way, it helps me see the beauty of things, and to be more concentrated at work. I feel happy, content and relax when working. 

"I like photography, but I am particularly interested in screen printing techniques for I understand colors very well. They are so smooth and clean. When I work with screen printing techniques, the work talks to me, it tells me things about myself. Flowers are very special to me. 

"The memory that I am most proud of is when I assisted welcoming HM the King on Visakha day. I was very glad to see HM in person, and I felt an immense joy when HM sprinkled water on us, the welcoming people. It meant that good news and luck would come soon. It was awe-inspiring to see elderly and disabled people making an effort to pay their respects. 

"Novica gives a chance to people and students without many choices to promote their artistic works. It is a very reliable project that will spread and make known the traditions and cultures of the world. My goal is to have enough time to continue working on arts, either part time or full time. It doesn't have to be restricted to the creative aspect, it could also be as a commentator, a critic or some form of expert."
