Description=
Using an abstract language of color, Andrea evokes the sound of flowers.
 Busy shapes spring outward from a fertile center filled with yellow pollen.
 Bumblebees leave golden paths as they browse the glowing images. 
"I was inspired by a verse from an anonymous poet," the artist confides.
 Jute and gauze add rich textures to this lovely composition. 

Titled "Suenan las flores" in Spanish.
