Description=
Superimposed on a crazy quilt of vivid color, a woman's face gazes 
quizzically at the viewer. All is movement in this busy composition
 as Miriam Chipana conjures a city that never sleeps. "The shapes are
 inspired by cave paintings and pre-Hispanic art," she confides. 
"Through her memory, the woman observes a city at night surrounded
 by strange and fantastic beings. Symbols and signs from tribal art 
are also present." 

Titled "Ciudad de noche" in Spanish.
