Enigmatic images and textural contrasts recall the grandeur of Moche
 artistry in a mixed media composition by Jesus Millones. He uses color
 with passionate intensity to translate the images wrought by poetry. 
"I lose myself in the paradise of your eyes, I lose because I am lost.
 I find myself in the peace of your lips because I am with you. I live 
in the universe of your soul with a thousand senses. In you I live, 
loving you," recites the Peruvian artist as he quotes the anonymous 
poem entitled "You Are My Paradise." 

Titled "Eres mi paraiso" in Spanish.
