Description=
Like a seed sharing its treasures, this painting by Surangrat 
captivates with wondrous energy. "I am inspired by organic forms 
such as trees, flowers, mother of pearl, leaves, etc.," says the 
Thai artist about this painting, part of her "Nature" series. 
Painting with offset ink, Surangrat uses a medley of palette knife, 
hard brush, spoons and plastic sheets to spread color.
