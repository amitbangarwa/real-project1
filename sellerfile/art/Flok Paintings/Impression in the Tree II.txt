Stylized lions guard a bodhi tree in this composition by Parinya Nanjai.
 It is said that Buddha achieved enlightenment while meditating beneath 
a bodhi tree, which then became known as the "enlightened" tree. Some of
 these trees in Thailand are said to derive from cuttings of the original
 bodhi, and people use stakes to prop their branches. 

Nanjai frames the painting in rubber tree wood.
