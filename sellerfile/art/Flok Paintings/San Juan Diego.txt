Juan Diego opens his cloak to reveal the Virgin of Guadalupe.
 She first appeared in Mexico in 1531 to this new saint. As proof of her visit,
 she caused roses to bloom at the site. Because church leaders did not 
believe he had seen her, she instructed him to gather a bouquet in his cloak,
 or tilma, and take them back with him. When the bishops opened the cloak,
 the Virgin's portrait appeared. The original tilma is on display in her 
Basilica in Mexico City. 

"Juan Diego is a model of humility for us all," says the artist.
