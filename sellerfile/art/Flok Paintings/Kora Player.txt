Description=
The kora is a string instrument, similar to the guitar, used primarily 
by people of the northern region of Ghana. Here a man is portrayed with 
his harmonic muse, dressed in traditional batik clothing and silhouetted
 in black ink. He suggests an intoxicating melody - one that has traveled
 long distances to inspire with sweet resonance. A musical vision to display 
in the home.
