Anika

"I'm Anika Mittal, and I was born in a small town in Uttar Pradesh where I did my schooling. After graduation, I pursued a three-year diploma in textile design. 

"While studying textile design, I developed a keen interest in painting. I was always mesmerized by the abstract and geometric patterns of Warli and Madhubani painting and eventually, I learned the exquisite art. These paintings mostly celebrate the simple and cheerful life of the village. 

"Warli painting is a traditional art form of the Warli tribe in Maharastra. This art mostly depicts everyday life, and most designs deal with the harvest seasons, celebration, weddings, rituals and births. 

"Warli paintings are usually done on mud-finished walls with rice flour used as paint. I use poster colors on textured handmade paper to bring paintings close to traditional quality. My inspiration comes from any and all forms of traditional arts. 

"What started as a mere hobby has become my passion now. I want to paint more and more and let the world see the traditions and values of our country through my creations. I am so glad to be associated with Novica. This is the first time I am venturing out to display my work. So am nervous and excited at the same time. I need your encouragement and support."
