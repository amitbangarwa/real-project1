"I was born in Khurda and brought up in Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Orissa. I work with my father in our small society that promotes patachitra painting (painting on cotton or silk) and palm leaf engraving. Ours is a family tradition. My father is an excellent artist, and my grandfather was also a fine artist of his times. They use to paint the walls of temples with portraits of deities. 

"In 1968, my father won a National Award from the government of India for palm leaf engraving. I respect him a great deal and I have learned this art from him. His skill in painting got him the post of superintendent in the State Institute of Handicraft Teaching Center. He is retired now and devotes his time to our humble home-run society. 

"After my 10th standard, I joined the State Institute of Handicraft and studied for a two-year diploma, and later went two years more to master the art. I have been very keen on painting since childhood. I think it is in my blood. I won several prizes in school. 

"Everyone in our family works in our society, and there are about ten others collaborating with us. 

My father has been in this field for more than 50 years and, during these years, he had the opportunity to participate in exhibitions including a couple overseas. The government of India sent him to Los Angeles for a demonstration and exhibition. He also participated in Indonesia. Together with him, I have also shown my work in many venues within India. I am very glad to be working under the guidance of my father."
