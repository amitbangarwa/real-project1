Jose Ponce de Leon

"I was born in the city of Cuzco on March 19, 1968. At the age of 15 I decided to come to the capital, where I live and create my art. My parents are artisans in Cuzco, and it was from them that I learned to appreciate art and work done by hand. At 12 years of age I began painting due to the influence of my older brothers, who are also painters. The techniques I use to improve my work are self-taught, but that doesn't mean that I have lost the desire to learn and improve everyday. 

"What keeps me motivated to work is my desire to bring to as many people as possible the message and peace of Christianity – to try to encourage newfound faith in an artistic way, and to show to the world the great artisanal tradition which has developed in Peru." 

José Ponce de León Ojeda signs his work "Ojeda," which corresponds to his mother's maiden name.
