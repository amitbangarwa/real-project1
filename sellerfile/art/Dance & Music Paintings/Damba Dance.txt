Description=
Poised on one foot, a graceful dancer whirls to a dance with the Damba tribe 
of northern Ghana. Dressed in a single cloth of batik, he wears beads and 
feathers on ankles and arms, and holds a traditional tool covered in kente cloth.
 Emmanuel Atiemoh Yeboah creates the exquisite scene in silhouette. "First and
 foremost, I assemble my working tools, after which I sketch images on the calico
 cloth," Yeboah explains. "With the sketches done, I sprinkle red and green oil 
paints on the calico cloth to give it a simple colorful background. I then cut
 out particular places I intend to replace with batik, which are later glued 
together. Afterwards, I dry and frame my collage work." 

Mixed media, this work of art comes in a frame of tweneboa wood.
