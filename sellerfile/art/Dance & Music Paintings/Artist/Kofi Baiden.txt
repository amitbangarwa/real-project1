Kofi Baiden

"My name is Kofi Baiden, the eldest son of Ghanaian parents. I was born on 28 October 1977, and I have a younger sister. During my leisure hours I listen to music while drawing on my small sketchpad. I also enjoy reading books about great and successful painters, because my dream is to establish not only a big art school, but also to become a great and renowned artist. 

"I studied Visual Arts at St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School, from 1994 to 1996. Then I proceeded to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, where I graduated second class in Fine Art in 2003. During my final year at the University I participated in the College of Art's week-long exhibition, where I sold most of my beautiful paintings. I became famous in the University as a result of that. I also exhibited at the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board in June of 2006. My greatest challenge has been my effort to be self-employed. 

"I started painting at a very tender age, and received prizes as one of the best Visual Arts students when I was in secondary school. I mainly work with oils and a few acrylics. My themes include African landscapes, figures, and a few abstract works. My paintings depict the cultural, social, and economic life of the people of Ghana, and for that matter, of Africa in general. 

"My paintings are characterized by a variety of beautiful images and colors, which makes the work more outstanding. My paintings come from my imagination, and they are inspired by the African environment."
