"I was born on September 5, 1978 in Accra, Ghana. I attended the Castle Road Methodist School for my basic education and then went to the Ghanatta College of Art for my secondary education, where I learned visual art and studied painting. I studied painting for three years here even though I already know how to paint. When I was a child I used to draw with crayons and other color pencils, so it was an interesting thing for me when I entered into this College of Art. After school I had an attachment with DAPEG LIMITED at Caprice in Accra for about three months for graphic designs. 

"I enjoy painting abstracts, compositions, village scenes, and beach scenes, and I usually use acrylic on canvas and card. I am inspired by the fact that I have the idea and I am encouraged to paint by that, even though there is no one in my family who is into arts and painting to specifically encourage me. Apart from painting, I play football in my free time. 

"I normally see everything as art, as art is life. It is a nice feeling when you are an artist, and I really enjoy being one."
