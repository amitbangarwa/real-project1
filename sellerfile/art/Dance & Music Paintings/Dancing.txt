Description=
Poised in the spotlight, dancers rise and gracefully twirl. The ballerinas are 
wreathed in the sheerest of tulle, each ethereal woman absorbed in her 
performance. With a realism that tends toward abstraction, Teodoro Reque
 pays tribute to classic ballet. 

This radiant and lyrical work of art is titled "Danzando" in Spanish.
