Bright lights illuminate the stage with a fantasy of colors as Dagomba 
chiefs perform the Damba dance. Painting with acrylics, Kofi Baiden shares 
his unique interpretation of the customs and beliefs of the Dagomba people 
from northern Ghana. According to their traditions, tribal chiefs can only 
perform the Damba, as the term suggests. It was originally choreographed to 
celebrate the birth of the Holy Prophet Mohammed, and now it is also performed
 to show a community's appreciation for a good harvest.
