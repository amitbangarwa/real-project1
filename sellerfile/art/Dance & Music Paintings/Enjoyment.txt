Description=
Plucking the strings of her contrabass, a woman accompanies herself in an
 expression of song. Harman depicts her in a cool sarong as she performs a
 solo concert. Cubist elements create the effect of a dream in this beautiful 
abstract portrait. "Self enjoyment is a positive way to avoid boredom and
 problems," the Javanese artist says.
