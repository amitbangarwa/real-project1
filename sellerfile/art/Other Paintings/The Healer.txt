Six hands reach out to grasp a seventh paler hand that encloses them all in
 a gentle yet warm and encompassing grip. The seekers encounter a healing
 presence in a beautiful expression of faith. Bernard Mensah paints a reverent
 work filled with West African icons such as the Adinkra that surround the hands.
 Ghana's adinkra symbols convey popular wisdom.
