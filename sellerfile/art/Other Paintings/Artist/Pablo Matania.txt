Pablo Matania

"My interest in art came about naturally when I was still a boy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I was born in 1936. At the age of eight, I used to create storyboards and illustrate little stories. It was only after the age of 20 that I began to paint. I have taken a few free courses, but I consider myself to be self-taught. I have experimented with various techniques, such as watercolor, oils, and painting with a spatula.

"I am a cartographer, and I used to be in the Argentinian Navy. While on a work-related trip in 1958, I stopped in Rio de Janeiro, experiencing my first contact with Brazil. The following year I left the Navy and went to work, again as a cartographer, with a private business in Tierra del Fuego in Argentina.

"In 1961 I abandoned cartography and decided to live through my artwork. At that time I embarked upon my greatest adventure: I went to live in Brazil. Without knowing anyone in the country, I arrived at the bus station in Rio de Janeiro, continued on to Copacabana [a neighborhood of Rio], and set up my easel on Avenida Atlântica [Atlantic Avenue], right on the seashore. Soon I was able to sell my paintings.

"The year was 1971. I was married with children, but my family had stayed behind in Argentina. The following year, owing to the success of my work, they came to join me in Rio.

"Rio de Janeiro is an alluring city. Its people and its atmosphere inspire me. A prime example of this inspiration can be seen in my series of beach paintings. I like to portray the human figure, and I feel that the scenery of Rio is the figures perfect setting. The colors and light of the sea transmit to me a sensation of pleasure and happiness.

"I am very curious about and have great expectations of Novica. It is a new world that is unveiled to me, replete with possibilities. I like new adventures, and I am very excited to see what the future will bring."
