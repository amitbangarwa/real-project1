Vera Lemos

Vera Lemos' first passion was teaching. She attended college and became a teacher shortly after graduation. It was only at the age of 40, when she took painting classes at the Fine Arts Brazilian Society, that she fell in love with creating art. She took additional art courses in which she perfected and diversified her technique, and shortly after started participating in important exhibitions in art showrooms. In 1997, she won the silver medal in the XVII Military Village Art Show, and a year later received an honorable mention in the First Military School Art Show. It is with this brilliant curriculum and experience that Vera Lemos brings us her notable artwork, which shines through with grace and radiance.
