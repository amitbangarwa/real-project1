Rattapon Pirat

"I once bought a few brush-pens and kept them for quite a while. When I finally wanted to use them, they'd been damage by insects. This taught me a lot. When we want to do something, we should just do it. 

"I'm Rattapon Pirat and my nickname is Palm. I was born in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand where my parents work as government officers on January 28, 1981. I am the youngest of three siblings. My first brother teaches music and my second brother is also a government officer. 

"I have always enjoyed drawing and painting, ever since I was a child. Everybody in my family also likes drawing, and they are my best supporters. I feel happy every time I paint. My hopes for the future are to continue doing what I love best. So, that's why I decided to study art and finally graduated with a university degree in fine arts. 

"Every day, after my routine is finished, I give all my time to drawing. The concepts and inspiration for my work come from city life. In the big city, everything seems to go very fast, such as the movement of light and color, all in motion. This last generates a good balance, a good mixture. All of these combinations seem to motivate everyone involved to speed up in everything to be able to catch up or even to move or act faster. 

"I believe that nothing in life is easy but I believe that it's not difficult to have everything happen in the way we want it to. I sometimes have to face the difficult times, the easy times or the funny times."
