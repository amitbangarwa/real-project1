Boni

"My name is Bonifacio Maxia Cutzal but, in my hometown, everyone calls me Boni and that's how I like to be known. 

"I was born on May 14, 1962, one of six children. My father worked in the fields. I remember I went to school, but only for one year. My family couldn't afford to keep me in school so, at the age of 11, I went to work in a clothing and shoe store. This brought an extra and very welcome income to my family. 

"When I was 15, I began my trajectory in art. There was a photograph of the Cathedral in Guatemala City that I liked very much. I tried to draw it, then I 'painted' it with colored pencils. That's how I became fascinated with the arts. I still have that drawing and I look at it when I need to remember why I began to paint. It helps motivate me when I see how much my work has evolved over more than 20 years as an artist. 

"My first painting in oil on canvas was of the Colonial Church of Comalapa. I sold it to a doctor from the capital in 1988. It measured 8 x 11 inches and I sold it for 8 quetzales. It wasn't much, but I felt great satisfaction because it was the first painting I sold as an artist. "I'm very grateful to my cousin for all I've accomplished. He was already an artist and he saw potential in my paintings. So he supported me a lot by giving me pigments and materials so I could work. Today I try to return the favor by helping others who need my assistance. Everyone who asks me for help receives it, if I can possibly do so. I'm proud that one of my students is my son – he is very interested in following in his father's footsteps as a painter. 

"I dedicate part of my time to farming because I'm not able to support my family through my paintings alone. In fact, I haven't painted for a while because of this.
