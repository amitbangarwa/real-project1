Time passes by so quickly, that it inspires Carlos Morales to freeze a 
moment through his art. He paints a scene from the city of Lima, with its
 ageless domes and bell towers in the distance. In the foreground, what once 
was a brand new, coveted car, now it's reduced to scrap, with chains keeping 
the doors together and bricks where tires used to be. "Humans share the same 
destiny," observes the Peruvian artist. He paints with watercolors, carefully 
detailing twisted metal and shiny church cupolas. 

Titled "Los años que se van" in Spanish.
