Description=
Assorted objects of iron cluster in a composition of pleasing geometry. 
Backed by a cloudy sky, they seem caressed by light. Working with a palette 
of brown, gold and rust, Vera Lemos finds beauty in each piece. "Just as art
 does, iron resists time despite the process of corrosion," she says.

Titled "Corrosão " in Portuguese.
