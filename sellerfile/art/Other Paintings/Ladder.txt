Description=
A ladder stands tall in a fallow field, reaching toward a glowering sky.
 Stretching laboriously, one rung at a time, a woman in traditional dress
 struggles up the ladder to the prize at the top – a single piece of bread.
 "The bread represents the effort it takes to get food in my country," says 
artist Bonifacio Maxia Cutzal, who signs his work as "Boni." He depicts the 
woman with an elongated torso and oversized feet, stylizations peculiar to 
his artistic identity. The canvas used is especially thick. 

Titled "Escalera" in Spanish.
