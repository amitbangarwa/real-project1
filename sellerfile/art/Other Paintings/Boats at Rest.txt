Description=
Anchored in a glassy lagoon, boats bob at rest. Pablo Matania exalts the contrast
 of white hulls and yellow slickers mirrored in the blue waters. He creates a 
peaceful portrait lulled by the cry of seagulls and the sound of lapping wavelets. 

Titled "Descanso dos Barcos" in Portuguese.
