Description=
Speeding toward a vanishing point, moving vehicles seem to implode at the 
horizon. Red taillights amid the night's blue shadows heighten the sensation,
 while a white skyscraper guides the eye to their burst of energy. This
 thoughtful cityscape by Thailand's Rattapon Pirat demonstrates his mastery 
of composition and color.
