Description=
"The main theme in my painting is to idealize
 the geography of northern Peru's coast, and 
the ancestral cultures that flourished there,
" explains Fernando Mauricio Ortiz. 
"They built their houses of clay, and they 
adored the moon." Ortiz mixes a palette of 
warm colors to convey desert temperatures, 
while figurative abstraction creates the illusion of a dream. 

Titled "Sueños de barro y luna" in Spanish.
