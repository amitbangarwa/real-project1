A narrow alley winds up and down a hilly village 
conjured by Peruvian artist Kenneth Hurtado. 
"I was inspired by the villages in the Andean sierra that
 are built with a mixture of local and Colonial architectural styles,
" says Hurtado of his inspiration. Painting with oils, he uses modeling
 paste to add an admirable textural dimension to his composition. 

Titled "Callejuela" in Spanish.
