Kenneth Hurtado

"I've inherited my passion for art from my parents who are artisans. They encouraged my siblings and me to study art when we finished high school. I'm from Apurimac in Peru, but due to family circumstances I went to the Central University of Ecuador and to finance my studies I traveled a lot with my paintings, exhibiting them where I could. 

"I returned to Peru seeking to settle and had a little stall to exhibit my work and show people the best of my art. 

"What I intend to do with each one of my paintings is to show the magic of color, recall childhood memories and share meaningful moments in my life. I enjoy experimenting with symbolic elements that reflect all that I carry with me inside."
