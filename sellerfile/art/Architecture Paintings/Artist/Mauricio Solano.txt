Mauricio Solano

"My interest in drawing began very early, at the age of six. I drew a lot as a child and, as an adolescent, I opted for the career of architecture. Always self taught, I rarely attended the artistic drawing classes at the university. 

"In 1981, I graduated from the school of architecture and urbanization and, in 1992, I began my first works in acrylic on canvas. I frequented the Lage Park School of Visual Arts and the studio of artist Souza Rodrigues where I developed my painting technique. The classes were held in the streets of Rio, in the Tijuca Forest, in the train stations. Once a week we had a class with live models. 

"I think painting is a talent that should be explored and I feel very good painting in the streets, the changing landscapes and the models, drinking in the beauty of what I see in a process of persistence, attempts, mistakes and success. I find it extremely gratifying. I complete many of my canvases at the studio, creating something that was not there in the street." 

Mauricio Solano has held two individual exhibitions in the Universidade Veiga de Almeida. He has participated in three collective exhibits and has received awards for his work.
