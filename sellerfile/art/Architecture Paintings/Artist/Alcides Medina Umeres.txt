Alcides Medina Umeres

Alcides Medina is a self-taught artist who was born in 1935, in a small Andean town in the state of Cuzco. He is well-known for the rich creativity and sensitivity of his paintings, all of which are dedicated to the night of the high hill country - as a profound and mysterious living being, that clothes ordinary scenes with glowing gentle beauty. 

"I find my inspiration in nature and my people, in the mountains and in the magnificence of the landscape, which provides the palette of colors I use. I look on all of these with eyes of love, trying to read and understand their subtle message. Painting is all I do, and fills me with a deep spiritual richness. I in turn attempt to convey emotions through the use of oils, brushes and palette knife, which I apply on canvases or corduroy. I prefer dark canvases - black, brown, blue - where I search for the contrast between warm and cold colors. 

"I have exhibited my work in the Lima Art Museum, as well as in many galleries and countries throughout Latin America and Brazil. I am very proud of the First Place prize I won in a national Ecological Art competition. I am grateful to Novica for the leading role it has assumed in the promotion of our art, and I am happy to contribute to the advancement of Peruvian culture in the world."

There are people who collect figurines or postage stamps or silver. Alcides Medina collects evenings illumined by the brilliant purity of the Andean moon.
