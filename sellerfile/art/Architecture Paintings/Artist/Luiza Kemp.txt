Luiza Kemp

"My house couldn't have been a more inspiring place for me to take my first steps in the universe of art. My father, Sérgio Mattos, is a recognized architect and sculptor, my mother, Tania Kemp, an architect and decorator. From both, I received a great incentive to create my first drawings and watercolors. 

"In my house we breathed art and design, and my first interest was in drawing, already manifest in school where handicraft classes were my favorite part of the day. Soon afterward, I took a course in photography, developing a technique that subsequently mixed my pictures with collages, tints and acrylics. 

"Through my work, I try to exercise my freedom and creativity, bringing me a tremendous inner peace. I can add to my pictures a new artistic element through collages and paints, creating an original and very decorative work that portrays the beautiful landscapes of southern Brazil."
