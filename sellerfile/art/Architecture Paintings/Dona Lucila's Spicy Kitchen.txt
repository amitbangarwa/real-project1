"This is a very old country kitchen, built of volcanic stone.
 The style and substance were also inherited from the ancestors, 
as can be appreciated here. The indispensable wood fire, the vessels 
of clay and, above all, the food based on spicy chili peppers," 
says Andean artist Alcides Medina. "This kitchen is located in 
the district of Sachaca, just a few kilometers from the city of Arequipa." 

Titled "Picantería Doña Lucila" in Spanish.
