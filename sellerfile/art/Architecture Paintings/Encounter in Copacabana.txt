Description=
Afternoon light imparts a sepia tone to a venerable old neighborhood 
of Rio de Janeiro. Beneath a shade tree, friends gather for conversation 
and a game of cards or dominoes. Mauricio Solano captures the dignity of 
Art Deco architecture, but also conveys the camaraderie of his subjects.
 "This was painted in the Sara Kubitschek Plaza in Copacabana," he confides. 

Named "Encontro em Copacabana" in Portuguese.
