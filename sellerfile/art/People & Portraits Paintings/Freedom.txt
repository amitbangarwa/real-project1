Description=
Innocence, light and a sense of magic exude from this painting by Brazil’s 
Candida Ferreira. Sitting together, three children enjoy the delights of 
friendship as they play on the beach, their reflection caught by tranquil 
ocean waters. Working with acrylics, Ferreira achieves remarkable realism. 

Titled "Liberdade" in Portuguese.
