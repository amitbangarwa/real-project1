Harman

"My name is Harman and I was born in Java on May 2, 1971. Since I was a child I loved art very much. I had a dream of becoming a professional painter so I tried hard to learn painting. I studied at SMSR Yogyakarta in 1987-1991; at ISI (Indonesian School of Art) I took the program of Interior Design until I graduated in 1996. Besides learning painting in a formal way, I also studied with a senior painter, Dulah. 

"Many people, including my family, considered that painting is not a good profession, relating to economic aspect. But I have faith in my way of life and will exist and be consistent in making paintings. I have received second prize in the Universal Painting competition in Yoyga, Central Java in 1989; second place in creating political caricature at IAIN Yogya, Central Java in 1990; and a third place prize in sketching gravity at Gramedia Jakarta in 1997. In 1988 I moved to Bali, known as the center of the world of art. Balinese social life and culture inspire me greatly. 

"I have participated in collective exhibitions with 'Pringgitan' at Kartapustaka in Yogya, Central Java in 1988; a collective exhibition of ten people in Kyoto, Japan in 1989; with 'Kurusekti' at Senisono in Yogya, Central Java in 1989; with 'Laser' at Sonobudoyo in Yogya, Central Java in 1990; with 'SMSR' at Purnabudaya in Yogya, Central Java in 1991; with 'Bunga-bunga Bali' at Kuta Center in Bali in 1999; with 'Studio 22' at the Ritz Colton Hotel in Bali in 1999; and a collective exhibition with 'Astetika Milenia' at the Bali Beach Hotel in Bali in 2000."
