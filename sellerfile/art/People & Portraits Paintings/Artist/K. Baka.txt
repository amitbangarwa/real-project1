K. Baka

Artist K. Baka has been featured in Red Herring magazine.

"My name is Kwabena Kufuor Afriyie-Addo Jr. (also known as K. Baka). I was born on Tuesday, July 2, 1968 in the eastern region of Ghana. My father is Benjamin Kwabena Kufuor Afriyie-Addo and my mother is Nancy Afriyie-Addo. 

"When I was a child, I used to draw a lot. I was so interested in art that in school it was the subject I got the highest marks for. Actually, it was a gift - a talent. I later entered art college for a three year diploma in art. After graduation, I established my studio in the house. While in school, I was painting and selling, so after school I did not need to undergo any brush-up or polishing. I do paintings, craftwork, billboards, screen-printing and signboards. In 1997, I had 20 students whom I taught painting, batik, and textile making. Also, many art students come to me for brushing or polishing. Presently I have two apprentices. 

"My paintings are natural, and I try to use inexpensive but high-quality material like calico, denim, military camp tents, and heavy curtain cloths. I find they are stronger than canvas. It also makes it possible to sell my works to a larger audience. I use acrylic paint because it dries faster and it lasts longer. I use phone cards for the painting instead of brushes because it gives me the effect that I want. For my paintings, many a time I see them in dreams and visions before I actually paint them. So in the morning I organize my materials and start painting.
