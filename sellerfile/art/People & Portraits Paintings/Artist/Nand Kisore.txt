Nand Kisore

"Hello, I am Nand Kishore and I come from the mesmerizing city of Jaipur, where fun and festivity never ends. My father was a painter back in the days when royals reigned. He used to paint the walls of royal homes, as well as their portraits. I was very young when I had my first encounter with painting. I used to enjoy my father's work and often copied him. I was the only child so I had all my parents' love and pampering. 

"My father taught me every detail about miniature painting. I left school when I was 15 years old to join him and once I mastered the art, I started in a professional way in 1975, three years after my father passed away. Though my father is here no more, I still draw inspiration from him. He is my Guru.
