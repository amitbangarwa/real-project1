Wayan Suarjiwatman

Wayan Suarjiwatman was born in the Gianyar regency of Bali on August 18, 1974. When he was only two years old he loved making sketches on his neighbor's wall and drawing puppets. After graduating from Junior High School, he continued to SMSR Ubud where he studied traditional painting for four years. Also he learned much by studying the works of senior Balinese painters. At STSI College of Art he focused on a modern painting style. 

Suarjiwatman strives to be a diversified artist, taking interest in varied activities such as dancing, playing music, theater, and painting. He inherited his ability from his grandmother, a famous painter in her own time. Currently, he is dedicated only to painting. He lives in a small studio along with about 200 of his paintings. He comes from a humble background, as his parents are farmers and practice a simpler way of life. 

In 1998, Suarjiwatman received a prize from STSI Denpasar College of Art as the best painter. He has participated in many exhibitions in Indonesia as well as a collective show in Australia in 1993.
