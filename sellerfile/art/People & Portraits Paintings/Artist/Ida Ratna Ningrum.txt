Ida Ratna Ningrum

"My name is Ida Ratna Ningrum and I was born in Central Java on March 11, 1978. To support my hobby, I graduated from elementary school in 1993 and continued my study to SMSR in Surakarta. I learned painting from my teacher and a senior painter. He, my senior, is my closest friend. He taught me how to paint step by step and with passion. Whenever I need guidance, he is always there for me. There was a time I will never forget - he asked me for a date and since then we are going out together. 

"The themes of my paintings are everyday life as it happens around me. Most of my paintings are in a realistic decorative style. Every time I take a walk I observe everything that comes to my sight and, when I find something interesting, I go home right away to transfer it into oil on canvas. I have actively joined some exhibitions, together with my friends from Surakarta. I hope my works will be accepted by art lovers around the world."
