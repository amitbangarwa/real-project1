Description=
With a look of infinite love, Jesus offers his wounded heart, 
wrapped in thorns and pierced by a centurion's sword. A symbol 
of Christ's love for man, the Sacred Heart was first venerated 
in 11th-century monasteries. Devotion to the Sacred Heart is devotion
 to Jesus himself, and Martín Pescador shares his own faith through 
this beautiful work of art. 

Titled "Bendito Corazón " in Spanish.
