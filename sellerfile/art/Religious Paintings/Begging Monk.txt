Description=
Robed in saffron cloak, a monk sits patiently with his sky-blue alms bowl. 
In the Buddhist tradition, people seeking to make merits bring food offerings
 or flowers, which constitute the monks' daily nourishment. When they are
 ordained, they are only allowed one begging bowl, one saffron or ochre robe,
 and one staff; in some sects, a pair of sandals and an umbrella. Wishing to 
share the intricacies of her Buddhist customs, Rutchanok Jinapun paints a 
composition laden with the charm of naiveté.
