Alberto Torres

Alberto Torres Merino discovered his love for art at a very early age. He was always interested in books that demonstrated different techniques of drawing and painting and, as time went on, he perfected his own technique and developed a personal style. Says Torres, "I consider myself a self-taught artist, and I use my artistic language to try to reach the heart of everyone." 

He works mainly in oils and wood-carving, embellished with gold and bronze leaf. 

As an artist, Torres is excited to be able to show his work to many more people, hoping to communicate his deepest feelings through his art.
