"I would like to send my heartfelt gratitude to all those who, through Novica and the magic of modern communications, have felt attracted to our work and made it part of their lives. Thank you for empathizing with the same emotions that drive us to create such compositions. Although it's impossible to reach perfection, as artists we placed all our energy into our work, without reserving anything of what we can give, often despite the difficulties in easily obtaining materials in our countries. I did all I could to give you the best I have to offer. Today I am pleased to write to you this letter and express our gratitude and motivation to keep on working in these beautiful arts; in my case it allows me to draw and paint every detail of this wonderful land. My most heartfelt wishes." 

"I was born in the countryside in the province of Jaen, department of Cajamarca. When I was about seven years old, I began to feel an aesthetic appreciation of all things visual. I was thirsty for all kinds of images such as the illustrations in books and magazines. My attention was drawn towards serpents, animals, and humans. 

"I discovered some of my painting abilities as well as a deep appreciation for the fine arts when I was at school, without it ever being a serious or deep undertaking. During my military service at the air force base in Las Palmas, Lima, I did some mural paintings, guided by common sense.
