Description=
Paying tribute to Thailand's ancient splendor, Tanachai Ekuruchaitep 
paints an impressive portrait of Buddha. He realistically depicts the 
master as a lifelike stone sculpture caressed by lichens. The style is 
that of Thailand's Ayutthaya period, showing the influence of Lopburi, 
a provincial capital of the Khmer empire whose art dates from the 11th
 century A.D.
