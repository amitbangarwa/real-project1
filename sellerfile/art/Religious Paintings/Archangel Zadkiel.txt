The archangel Zadkiel is a benevolent presence with a kind face.
 Yet he grasps a bolt of lightning and holds it aloft to demonstrate his power.
 The angel's mission is to help achieve forgiveness and to assist with spiritual
 doubt. Beautifully portrayed by Fernando Sayan Polo, the heavenly messenger
 takes the style of Cuzco's colonial paintings. 

Titled "Arcángel Zadkiel" in Spanish.
