Description=
Andean artist Joseph de Utia found the inspiration for this painting in the work
 of Marc Chagall. Orca whales are a favorite theme for De Utia. "The killer
 whales – those great predators – are themselves threatened by humans, by 
pollution and climate changes," he says. His style is lyrical, almost musical
 as he depicts huge sea waves where ships invade the habitat of these intelligent
 creatures. The sun burns red due to global warming. 

Titled "Orcas en el Artico" in Spanish.
