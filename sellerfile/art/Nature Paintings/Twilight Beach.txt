Golden light envelops rugged rocks that jut into the ocean. The darkening 
sky intensifies the glorious colors of sunlight reflected on the water. 
Washing gently to shore, the waves are tinted with rose and orchid that 
contrast with deep sapphire and sunny yellow. Prachuap Chaikham-udom paints
 an enchanted island scene from Thailand.
