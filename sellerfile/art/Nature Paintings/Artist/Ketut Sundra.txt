Ketut Sundra

Ketut Sundra was born in Bali on January 13, 1952. His village is known as the village of coffee, for all one can see along the street are plentiful coffee trees. Planting coffee has been the main subsistence of people in the village for many years. But young Sundra wanted to prove to his family he could live better without locking his whole life in his village, where he could hope only to plant coffee trees and watch them grow. He broke into the art world and began studying art in junior high school with Ketut Kasta and Wayan Jujul. Since then he has created many paintings, most of them inspired by Balinese daily life. Although it was difficult for him, Sundra never gave up his dream and worked hard to survive in his chosen world of painting. Today the artist lives happily in Denpasar together with his wife and children. 

Sundra is very grateful for the chance to display his talent through Novica. He has exhibited his works at the Volkenkundig Museum Nusantara in Delft, Holland (1986,) at Bentara Budaya in Jakarta (1987), and in the Balinese Art Festival at the Art Center in Denpasar, Bali (1986, 1987, 2001).
