Joseph de Utia

"I was born in Lima in May of 1968, during the era of the hippies I never knew. I grew up in an atmosphere in which we didn't know much about art, but I was always fascinated by Disney drawings. When I was an adolescent, I'd draw them in my notebooks, then paint them with watercolor and tempera. When I graduated, I studied graphic design, then worked as an art director in advertising agencies. At the same time, I ventured into the fine arts. I met a number of young painters with whom I interacted. 

"My formation as an artist comes from the School of Fine Arts and Graphic Design of the Instituto de Diseño Montessori. I've been dedicated to art since 1997 after leaving the field of publicity. Together with friends who are also fine artists, I've been showing my work. Leaving the agency affected my income, but art fills me with satisfaction and I'm able to live a tranquil life. I could never have turned away from painting, as it is my passion, my maximum form of expression. 

"Once when I was just beginning, I went to an art collector who spent time with me. He showed me his gallery and the works of excellent masters, and encouraged me to paint several projects and to dedicate myself entirely to painting. Later, I met the Reverend Estrada, who has been my spiritual father. He asked me to paint a large scale canvas, but I wasn't ready in those days. Reverend Estrada and been my main source of encouragement in following the call of art; he believed in me even when I didn't have a path defined. Many years later, I heard he had lost his home and everything to Hurricane Katrina.
