Gabriel Juarez

"I place all of myself in each painting I create. My passion for nature, for the urban and for the elements that surround me is necessarily a great source of inspiration. 

"I was born in Lima on October 18, 1979. My inclination toward painting from the time I was a child led me to study drawing and painting in the Lima Museum of Art for a year before I finished high school. Then, in 1997, I was accepted at the Escuela Nacional Superior Autónoma de Bellas Artes del Perú where I graduated in 2003. Afterward, I took courses in digital graphic design in the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería. 

"From then on, I've dedicated my time completely to my painting, developing and seeking a particular expression: a language of my own in a world of color, of forms, of textures, of techniques. Sometimes I find great satisfaction in representing a realistic scene, but most times I create abstracts in which I feel I can develop myself to a greater extent. 

"I've come to master the technique of gold and silver leaf, etc., which I sometimes utilize in my canvases when I want to enhance the light and brightness. 

"When you choose one of my works and accept it into your family, I feel both proud and comforted."
