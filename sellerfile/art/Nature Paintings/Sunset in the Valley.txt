Description=
Bent to the plow, an Andean farmer guides his oxen across fertile fields. 
The sun slips behind distant mountains, forming a halo around man and animal.
 Carlos Morales works in oils to depict an idyllic landscape of peace and beauty.
 Roiling clouds overhead hang low with the promise of life-giving rain. 

Titled "Atardecer en el valle" in Spanish.
