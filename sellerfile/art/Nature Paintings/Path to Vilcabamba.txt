Description=
Setting his easel next to an old Inca trail, Alcides Medina proceeds to 
capture the beauty of the Andes in this oil on canvas. "A woman carrying 
firewood on her back is walking on the old path going from the Yanama Mountain
 through Choquequirao district toward Vilcabamba, the last city of the Inca
 to fall to the Spanish in 1572." Medina combines a palette of vibrant oil
 colors, successfully capturing the beauty of the land with admirable realism. 

Titled "Sendero a Vilcabamba" in Spanish. s
