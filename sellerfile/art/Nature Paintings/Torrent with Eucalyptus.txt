Crystalline waters cascade down the face of a cliff in a white torrent beneath 
an azure sky. In the foreground, eucalyptus trees rustle in the wind. Raúl 
Cárdenas pays tribute to the Andean trilogy venerated by pre-Hispanic peoples 
– earth, air and water. "These basic elements are converted into gods that 
permit our survival," the artist explains. 

Titled "Torrente con eucaliptos" in Spanish.
