Antonio Meijueiro

"I strive to transmit, through my paintings, my moment of creation. The local atmosphere, the light, the colors, the forms, since my paintings are created in plein air. I try to portray my time. 

"When I was still a child, I began to become aware of the great fascination that art exerted on me. Ever since, in one way or another, art has been present in my life. 

"Just like any other person, I have faced the challenges of life, but none greater than I was able to bear. I was very much attracted to painting in 2000. This was a time of sudden changes in my life and I was attending to a deep need for expression, of completion of the soul. From there, things just flowed naturally, without any worries or even a plan for transforming my encounter with art into future profession." Antonio Meijueiro was born in Rio de Janeiro where he lives today. He has walked a sensitive and practical path through design projects, later enriched by architecture. Meijueiro specialized in creating furniture and decorative objects as well as spaces and perspectives fundamental to beauty and comfort. 

In November of 1999, at the age of 42, Meijueiro began studying painting in the studio of artist Souza Rodrigues. Since then, he has participated in exhibitions and awards in Brazil and other countries, including a solo show at the International Maison in Rennes, France, in 2005. 

Meijueiro masterfully represents urban scenes and is also able to portray the human presence, strongly and sometimes with sweetness and simplicity in its magnitude. 

"Painting is a lonely art. But it is gratifying to know that my work – where I try to express all my feelings – will be contemplated by so many people of different countries. The world will see it through the 'bridge' that Novica offers us."
