Darutsawin Meesap

"My name is Darutsawin Meesap, but friends call me 'Bowl.' My name, Darutsawin, means 'someone who is brief and an expert in every thing.' I was born on January 3, 1981. I have two older sisters, so we're a family of five. 

"My father loves three things in life: first, his family; second, agriculture and third, art. However, several years ago, he stopped working on his art - I don't know the reason why. He became entirely focused on farm matters. My mother is an intelligent woman and she can cook very well. Since I'm the youngest, every one looked after me. 

"But my parents separated in 2000. I kept telling myself that everything would be all right, but I didn't know for sure. I used to have a warm, close family. Suddenly, when I looked around, I saw no one and felt so cold. 

"My father lives in a northern province and my mother lives in a different province. She is a social worker now. One of my sisters is married and lives with her family in Bangkok, and the other one lives with me. We always phone each other and we often meet. But the more we call each other, the lonelier I feel. 

"I was born in Chiang Mai but I grew up in Lampang province, where my father had an orange farm. I lived within a big family since my grandparents lived with us. My father likes pets and we inherited his love for animals. Among our pets we have dogs, a cat, a horse, oxen and fish. Since there's between four and five years difference between my sisters and me, I always tended to play with my dog - my loyal friend.
