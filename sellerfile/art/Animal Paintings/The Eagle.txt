Melding the face of a woman with the features of a bird,
 Jacira Baptista creates a dramatic allegory in black and white.
 The bold lines soar upward, raising the portrait to a metaphysical level.
 "The eagle is queen of the birds; she flies high and has broad vision. 
She symbolizes power and freedom," Baptista says of this pen and ink design. 
"The woman eagle offers her heart for those who, even with open eyes, 
are unable to see." Titled "A Águia" in Portuguese.
