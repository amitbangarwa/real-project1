Description=
With quiet, assured steps, horses head homeward at sunset, 
while colts prance restlessly at their side. Adolfo C'colque 
exercises a visual form of magical realism in this exquisite 
equine portrait. Lucid oils convey the vitality of these noble 
animals that, for the artist, represent freedom. 

Titled "Regreso en el Ocaso" in Spanish.
