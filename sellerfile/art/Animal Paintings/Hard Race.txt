"And... they're off!" The excitement of a race is palpable as magnificent 
thoroughbreds thunder down the track in search of victory. Wearing the silks
 of their respective stables, lithe jockeys urge their steeds onward while 
spectators cheer. Antonio Meijueiro paints this vibrant instant from an 
afternoon at the track.
