A golden blossom's sweet fragrance entices a yearning butterfly in a 
symbol of sexual desire. "I try to explore eroticism from a new angle,
" artist Jay Karun explains. "I take simple, everyday elements in nature 
to create an erotically charged atmosphere that reflects the raw sensual 
urge to procreate. Hence, viewed from a particular perspective, every element
 in nature can evoke sensuality." The green background is richly fertile.
