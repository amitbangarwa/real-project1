Description=
Bathed in golden light, lotus flowers flourish. Buddha taught that all
 living creatures exist within the cycle of life – birth, age, death –
 but a wholesome existence guided by proper understanding, contemplation,
 and concentration releases one. Beautifully depicted by Noppadon Kamkong,
 the lotus is Buddha's preferred offering.
