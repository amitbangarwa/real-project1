"Sawaddee krab. I was born and live in Chiang Mai province. We are a warm family of four – my parents, elder sister and me. Everyone calls me Aun. My father was the assistant to village headman and taking care of his villagers was his main task. My mother was homemaker. She worked part time making Thai desserts wrapped in banana leaves to sell weekday afternoons. Most of her customers were pre-school children from the kindergarten near our house. It was a healthy, reasonable priced treat that generations loved – in fact, some children came back as adolescents to buy my mother's desserts. Obviously, I can say that, thanks to them, I grew up. 

"When I was young, life was happiness. I never missed any of the traditional Thai ceremonies in our village because my father always wanted me to participate. Among my traditional performances, I very much like the Tob MaPhab dance. "Maphab" is an ancient Northern Thai word meaning "firecracker" and "Tob" means "beat or hit." Tob Maphab is a male dance in which performers use both hands to beat on their bodies in a graceful manner. This action makes a noise like a firecracker. 

"My father explained that this kind of dance showed the art of brave fighter. Sometimes a sword or a wooden pole could be used while dancing. Today we no longer fight with ancient weapons. But we preserved the style and identity of the old time performance, a Thai tradition. While in primary school, I had a chance to show the Tob Maphab dance. I'd learned it wasn't easy to make the noise like a firecracker. My friends and I tried beating our bodies to imitate the sound but we never even got close. Instead, our bodies became red. When it was time for the show, we had a skillful senior leader to help us, and we enjoyed it very much.
