Anna Trancoso

"Vibrant coloring, generous palette knife movements, and much intensity define the profile of my work, considered by some critics to be figurative expressionism. I've been dedicated to painting since 1972. I began my career in the Hippie Fair, moving on to participate in diverse collective and individual exhibitions in Brazil and abroad, such as a showing in Rome to which I brought a colorful Brazilian facet. 

"My style is in constant evolution, but I never abandon the strong colors that accompany me like traces left in time. Writing about my exhibition in Italy in 1979, the critic Walmir Ayala said: 

Anna Luiza Trancoso follows the natural path of all artists who, compelled by some existential circumstance, enter almost compulsively into the process of art." 

Trancoso has been honored with numerous awards in Brazil, participating in countless individual and collective exhibitions. Besides her individual showing in Rome, she has also participated in collective exhibitions in Amsterdam and Los Angeles.
