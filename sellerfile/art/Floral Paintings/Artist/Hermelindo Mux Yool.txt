"I was born in the province of Chimaltenango and I remember my childhood days spent traveling with my mother from village to village. She sold all types of sweets and my father was a vendor too. All the while, my interests laid in drawing and in elementary school I began to paint with watercolors. I remember well the first painting I made, watercolor on paper, and though I didn’t know much about technique I hung that painting at home. I still recall my dad’s words: 'My son is going to be an artist!' That's all I needed to hear – my dad's words filled my heart and encouraged me to follow my dreams. That painting stayed on the wall for a few years, until it got all dirty and began to tear. 

"I come from a village of artists, many of whom are well-known and they inspired me to walk on this path of life. When I was in school I hurried my homework so I could have time to paint. Nowadays, when the sale of my paintings is not going as desired, I supplement my income by working in the fields. 

"At first all I painted was about my country's customs because I loved to be able to share them. Then, somehow I began to feel curious as to how these customs began and where they come from, which allowed for more depth to my paintings. What I enjoy the most of my work as an artist is to be able to express myself through color. The greatest challenge is avoiding getting stuck, to always have the creativity to paint new things and not be repetitive. 

"One of the most difficult lessons I have had to learn is to balance my lifestyle between the times when there is enough money and when there isn't enough to feed my family. It's been a hard lesson to learn, but now I know that when there is money I have to save for the proverbial rainy day, when the Lord might have other tests for me. All of this has made me reflect on the paths we take in life, and that's how my friends describe me: as quiet, as a person that reflects upon life and its highways.
