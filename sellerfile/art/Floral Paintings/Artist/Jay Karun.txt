Jay Karun

"I love to delve deep into my mind and explore the imagery that revolves around it. I would say that my art is an impressionistic ensemble of energetic colors and bold strokes. Each of my paintings is an exploration, deep into the psyche of individual and collective consciousness. 

"My passion for art started very early. I was born on March 14, 1970 in Cochin, Kerala. During my schooldays, I regularly participated in painting competitions and won several prizes for the same. My endless passion for art led me to study fine arts. I did my Graduation in Fine Arts from Tripunithura, the erstwhile capital of present day Kochi, in Kerala. 

"During the pre-independence era, the royal dynasties nourished art and culture to such an extent that Tripunithura flourished under their patronage. I spent my formative years imbibing this rich culture and heritage, which had a far reaching impact on my thinking and my artistic impulses. 

"I started my career as a graphic designer and am presently working as associate creative director in a well known advertising agency in India. To keep in touch with my real passion, I regularly do paintings. 

"I work mostly in acrylic on canvas, oil on canvas, digital art, collage, charcoal on paper, mixed media, etc. But I usually think of the idea first and then choose a process or technique that will lend expression to the concept in the best manner. 

"Each new day, each new experience inspires me – the world around me, nature, people, events, places… all these are my sources of inspiration. 

"I have exhibited my work in different solo and group exhibitions in my home state. My painting was also selected for display in the Lalitha Kala Academy, which is a great honor for any artist. 

"I am so delighted to be a part of Novica. It is an online exhibition platform without boundaries, and therefore has limitless opportunities for people like me."
