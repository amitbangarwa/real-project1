Prachuap Chaikham-udom

"My name is Prachuap Chaikham-udom and I was born on March 24, 1957. My parents have five children and I am the second oldest. Our family owns a Thai sweetmeat making business. My brothers and sisters and I were always the assistants for my mother. She is a great northern Thai sweetmeat maker - if you have ever tasted her work you will never forget it. Her products have been famous for many years – over 50 years! Many people have ordered her works from many places and we always had a lot of work every day. We woke up early every morning, at 4 am, to prepare the ingredients of the sweetmeat. The children helped out by stirring the mix together and helping in any other details. You know, ever since I was young I have always helped my mother out and watched her, as she was mixing the ingredients, making the portions, when she did everything. But no one can make it taste like hers, not even me or my sisters. 

"My mother has influenced my life in every way. She is the one who took care of us five children with her own hands. Ever since I was young I was interested in painting and loved to draw. It started when I was at primary school. I saw my friend standing in the door of the classroom and was impressed by his pose. I drew it on one of my books and thought it turned out quite well. I've been inspired to create portrait paintings since that time and have never stopped painting and drawing. For sure, my mother supported me to do the things that I wanted to do. This made me more confident and forward. I chose to learn more about art at the painter's high school and continued on in the arts faculty of the technological institute. I focused on portraits - human, animal, plant and flowers. I love to create compositions and light, especially pictures with movement.
