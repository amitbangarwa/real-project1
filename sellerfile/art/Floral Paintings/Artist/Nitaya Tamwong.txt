Nitaya Tamwong

"My name is Nitaya Tamwong. I was born on November 26, 1968. I grew up in a farming family, and I have only one brother. I attended primary school and high school in my hometown. After that I studied art at a technological institute in the city. Even though my parents would support me, they didn't like the idea of studying art. So I couldn't tell them until after I passed the exam. They eventually supported my studies, although they didn't understand what I could do with art in the future. 

"I've loved art since I was very young, beginning when I was about seven or eight years old. I always enjoyed drawing. I always got very good grades in drawing class or anything that was related to drawing or painting. 

"After graduating I worked for a few companies. All my work was related to the arts. But it wasn't exactly what I wanted, so I would always find something I liked to do during my free time. For a while I used to draw portraits at the market, but I only did this for a few years. 

"In 1998 I decided to concentrate on the style of art I truly loved. I always enjoyed working on the details of rural scenes. It contains so many things that I like to present to people; the easy-going way of life has always attracted my attention. It's always simple but full of meaning."
