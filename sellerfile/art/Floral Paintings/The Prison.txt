According to Maya cosmogony, they are the "People of the Corn,
" and Hermelindo Mux Yool dedicates this oil on canvas to them. 
"The Maya people have suffered exploitation and alienation for over
 500 years, that is why I portrayed handcuffs around two corn stalks,
" explains the talented Guatemalan artist. "It makes me sad that not 
even their own country recognizes them." 

Titled "La cárcel" in Spanish.
